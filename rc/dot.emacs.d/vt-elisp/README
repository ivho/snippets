README for vt-elisp
===================

This CVS module contains some Emacs Lisp files that are useful for us
working at Virtutech.  Some of them are actually useful even if you're
not working at Virtutech.

For easy access to the stuff in here, add the following to your .emacs
file:

        (setq load-path (cons "/home/packages/vt-elisp" load-path))
        (load "vt-elisp-start")

If you have your own checked-out copy of vt-elisp, use that instead of
"/home/packages/vt-elisp".

* bugz.el

This is a read-only frontend to Bugzilla.  Read the documentation in
the file for more information.  To get you started, try the following:

        M-x bugz-list
        M-x bugz-view-bug

* ddl-mode.el

This is a major mode for editing DDL (devgen) files.  It includes
things such as indentation help and font-lock colorization. 

* disassemble.el

This file contains a command that will let you see disassembly of an
object file (or binary) together with the source.  To start it, use:

        M-x disasm-file

and give it the name of an object file (or library or executable)
compiled with debug info.

* ifdef.el

This file provides a minor mode that hightlights #ifdef'ed sections of
a source file, and provides some useful commands for examining
preprocessor defines.

The commands in this minor mode are bound to key sequences starting
with C-c #.  To see them all, use C-h # C-h.

The vt-elisp-start file installs this mode to be enabled for all C
files.

* references.el

This was something Marielle wrote for her thesis.

* simgen.el

This file contains an editing mode for SimGen files.

* simics-conf.el

This file contains an editing mode for Simics configuration files.

* simics.el

This is the interactive Simics mode.  It lets you run Simics in an
Emacs buffer, complete with tab-completion, and other special
features.  To start it, use:

        M-x simics

Have fun,
David
